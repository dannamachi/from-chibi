You know I no longer have full admin access over Luvluv ever since I joined this organization. It was truly a mistake. You're the only one I can trust here; please shut down Luvluv Virtual Assistant before the leaders can use it to launch an attack on the Rimorian government. I'm counting on you.",\

I predict that the overspace connection would have been completely cut off, as desired by the OHUK leaders, but as long as you have a working terminal that can send out radiowaves, you will be able to re-establish connection. However, you will have to encapsulate the package being sent out with some specific frames for it to be accepted by the overspace access points. I've attached a script that can facilitate this process - just make sure you have an interrupted emission and you will be able to connect to overspace. I wish you best of luck, and sorry that we couldn't stop what has happened to your world.",\
