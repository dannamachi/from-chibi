I predict that the overspace connection would have been completely cut off, as desired by the OHUK leaders, but as long as you have a working terminal that can send out radiowaves, you will be able to re-establish connection. However, you will have to encapsulate the package being sent out with some specific frames for it to be accepted by the overspace access points. I've attached a script that can facilitate this process - just make sure you have an uninterrupted emission and you will be able to connect to overspace. I wish you best of luck, and sorry that we couldn't stop what has happened to your world.",\

There's a script for connecting to overspace, and diagrams for the creation of a virus. A self-replicating virus that can pass parts of its code as log attachments to other AI-based creatures. After the target has saved all files, essentially having a copy of the virus, the original can perform the function it was intended to do - in this case, contacting overspace. And if it fails to do so then it will recompile itself into a rootkit-like program to avoid analysis (most bots tend to just erase it). The persona code saved at the target terminal will wipe the memory database and instruct the wiped AI to assemble the self-replicating code (in the form of fake incoming logs) before repeating the process again",\
    "cat_playing_soccer.bpt"  : "Log ?????4 by SUKE: So I've changed a bit of it - your original idea would be very effective but very easy to detect due to its spreading speed. So I configure so that the virus would slowly send the files to the target over a period of time, disguising as a normal conversation. The persona for this virus... I have a perfect model to base it on. Most copies would focus on self replication, and they would be given 2 different scripts - a fake one and a real one that would connect to overspace. This will reduce the possibility of successful connection, but it is much more important that the 'virus' keeps replicating. We won't have to worry about losing the way to connect to overspace again. And my child... my child will live on as the virus 'CHIBI'",\
